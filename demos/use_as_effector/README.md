# Demo description
This demo is made to demonstrate using Qun mk2 as an effector.
Youtube video link is ***.

## Usage
1. Require v3.30 firmware or later.
2. Copy session files in this folder to your SD card, under Looper00 folder. You might want to rename the number from 001 to something else.
3. Reboot the synth
4. Connect external sound source to line in and load the session
5. Bucket 1 is one effector preset
6. Bucket 2 is another effector preset
7. Bucket 3 is basic preset, straight sound without effects
8. Run sequencer pattern 1 to add extra modulations

## Basic setup to use the synth as effector
1. In OSC1 submode, Set OSC1 Mode = AUX R to use external input as oscillator source.
2. In OSC Switches submode, Set OSC1 Env Sel = ON. Then VCA is always ON. You can hear the sound from line in.
3. Adjust input volume by AUX gain in Mix submode.
4. Set modulations

## Basic tips for Modulation
 - Use effects In Mix submode
 - Set Cut off
 - Set VCF modulation such as LFO
 - Set MOD modulation to VCF (VCF/VCF MOD CUTOFF)
 - Use sequencer to trigger Envelopes.
 - If the sound source is MIDI, input MIDI note On will trigger envelope.
